## Description
In the simple development of this page, I included things that can ease the navigation of the users through the page.
  This page was created to simplify the work done by both students and teachers as well as the contractors;also to save their time by just entering few numbers to determine the kind of triangle they want.
  I created simple HTML forms with simple js.script function to calculate and tell the user the triangle formed.
  I also enhanced the view with simple css styles to make it more attractive.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* you only need a well updated browser and a working internet to access this page.

## Known Bugs
The page is still under development and in good working condition.
## Technologies Used
I used page break to make the entry box more clear
